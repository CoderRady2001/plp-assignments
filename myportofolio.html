        <h3>Project 1</h3>

        <p>My first project was a project where I was able to develop a website for a kenya start up company
            which entails sending money from Abroad to Kenya. With This project I was able to make a major progress
            in the field of development.
            <br>
            With the same Project I was able to make big progress and I also received another project which is project
            2, which I have highlighted after this project.
            <br>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
                After the first Project I secured another project which involved designing the website of car importation.
                This was one of the best gig I secured and which opened very many other doors. I have received so many
                clients after designing this project 2.

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>My project 3 was one project for the books which distinguished me as one of the Top 
                web developers in the country.
                <br>
                The project was mainly on designing an Taxi app for a company in Kenya which is known as Faras
                .I had so much fun and exposure working on this project.

                <h3>Project 4</h3>
                <p> My final and the most recent project which I have done is my project about buidling the electoral
                    website for Kenya Elections. This Project was incorporated by me and several other Friends who are my
                    colleagues.
                    <br>
                    The project was a big success towards fixing the bugs which are there in the electoral process at large.
